# Digithon Android Mobile UI Prototype

## Description

- Repository is to contain all code relevant to the Android Prototype base for the Digithon Hackathon event 2023

## Technical Outline

- The repository sample will follow an MVVM coding paradigm, with three main layers setup for the demonstration code:
  - Data - All direct data integrations and interactions will occur within this layer
  - Domain - Middle layer for interactions and all state value calculations to occur for UI interactions and actions
  - Presenter - UI screens and all presentational features of the code should be within
  - Core - Shared UI Components layer

- Gradle configurations have been setup to have base level application operational
